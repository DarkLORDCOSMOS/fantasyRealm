INTRO

This is an adaption of Jotaf's libtcod python tutorial game using BearLibTerminal as display.


I generated this example for everybody who looks for different display option for the well-known and excellently written libtcod python tutorial. The tutorial brought me to roguelike development and enabled me to do my own games with it. I discovered BLT recently and like the use of TrueType fonts and other features. 

The script is basically unchanged apart from including the terminal, using old-school wall and tiles and I also added a different type of selection menues.
